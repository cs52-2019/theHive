# The Hive
The Hive is a special projects unit of USA for UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency. They are a team of digital and data strategists who find creative ways of addressing the global refugee crisis. One key area of focus for the Hive is to identify strategies to increase donations. This includes increasing donor engagement and shifting the conversation around refugees in the US.

# The Challenge
The Hive wishes to identify social media users on Twitter who are influential, or have potential to be influential, in the online conversation about refugees. Knowing who these users are can help them better target their online outreach, and identify Twitter users who might become advocates for the Hive's messages about refugees. 

# Our solution
Our team and the Hive agreed to create a tools which can help to identify Twitter users who have a history of tweeting about refugees, and have high reach and engagement. The tool identifies Twitter users in specific regions of the US whose tweets in relation to refugees are widely retweeted or replied to.

# Our Demo

Please see the videos below, which show how the tool works. 

## Demo 1: The map interface, displaying the Twitter users by location, with the number of followers in circles. The panel on the right ranks the influencers visible in the map by their level of influence and attaches a label based on the following:

1K – 100K followers = MICRO influencers
100K – 500K followers = MID-tier influencers
500K – 2M followers = MACRO influencers
2M+ followers = all-STAR influencers
